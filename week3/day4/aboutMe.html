      <p>Hello, my name is Tatien Miller. A little about me: I am from Kansas City and I obviously like to code, but more on that in a bit... Hobby wise, I enjoy playing with my cat, going on walks in nature, watching movies and/or TV, reading, and many more SUPER interesting things. As far as coding goes, I am a Full Stack Developer. I specialize in the front-end, or user interface, aspect of projects, as well as the back-end, which deals more with data transfer and so on. Basically everything you need to have a product web and user ready.</p>

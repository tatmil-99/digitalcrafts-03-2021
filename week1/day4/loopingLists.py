lists = ["item", 2, True, "hey"]

# print(len(list)) 

# can loop over a list. while requires a condition
# index = 0
# while index < len(lists):
#   list = lists[index]
#   print("What item are you? I'm a %s" % list) 
#   index += 1 

# for loop (for ... in). better to use for lists than while loops 
# lists index after each item 
# count = 0
# for list in lists:
#   print(list) 
#   print(count)
#   count += 1

# combining lists 
  # use + 

# how do we modify a list?
